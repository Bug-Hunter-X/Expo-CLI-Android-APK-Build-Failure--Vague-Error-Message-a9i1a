This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The error message is typically vague, such as "Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugGoogleServices".  It might be related to issues with Google services configuration or conflicts within the project's build process.  This bug is difficult to trace because the root cause is not directly apparent in the error message itself.
