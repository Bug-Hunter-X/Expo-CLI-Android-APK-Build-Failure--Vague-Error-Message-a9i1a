The solution often lies in carefully reviewing the Google Services configuration and Gradle files. 

1. **Verify google-services.json:** Ensure this file is accurately placed within the `android/app` directory of your Expo project.  Double-check that its contents accurately reflect your Firebase project's settings. 

2. **Inspect Gradle Files (build.gradle):** Pay close attention to the dependencies and plugin configurations. Look for any version conflicts or missing plugins related to Google services integration.  Try to update Gradle to the latest stable version.

3. **Clean and Rebuild:** Before attempting any code modifications, always try a clean build. Use `expo prebuild --clean` to clear any cached files that might be causing the problem, and then rerun the build command (`expo build:android`).

4. **Check for conflicting dependencies:** It's possible that some of your project dependencies clash with the requirements of Google services integration.  Use the Expo tools to examine the dependency tree and look for any incompatible packages.
