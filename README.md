# Expo CLI Android APK Build Failure: Vague Error

This repository demonstrates a common, yet elusive, bug encountered when building Android APKs using the Expo CLI. The error message is usually unhelpful, making debugging challenging.  The root cause often stems from misconfigurations related to Google services or inconsistencies within the project's build system. 

This repository provides a sample project and a potential solution. While the exact error might vary, the underlying principles and debugging strategies are consistent across similar cases.

## Reproducing the Bug

The `bug.js` file contains a simplified representation of a project that might trigger this vague build error. You can modify it to investigate the problem within your specific context.  The exact reproduction steps depend on your individual setup but likely involve running `expo build:android`.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file offers a potential remedy. It typically involves checking the following: 

* **Google Services JSON:** Ensure your `google-services.json` file is correctly configured and placed in the appropriate directory (android/app).
* **Gradle Configuration:** Review your Gradle files (build.gradle) for any potential conflicts or misconfigurations, especially those related to Google services.
* **Dependencies:** Make sure all your dependencies are compatible and updated.
* **Clean and Rebuild:** Try cleaning your project's cache (`expo prebuild --clean`) and then building again.
